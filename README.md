- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page]

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Here](https://g3rardogo.github.io/clipboard-landing-page/html/index.html)

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control system
- [Pug](https://pughtml.com/) - HTML preprocesor
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocesor
- [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) - Compiler

### What I learned

This is my first project using Pug as HTML preprocessor and using Sass as CSS preprocessor. I discovered the super power of preprocessors and how much time I can save. With Sass I save many unnecessary lines of code and the process speeds up a lot. On the other hand, with Pug the html becomes simpler, you only worry about the content of the page, always respecting the semantic HTML.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on future projects using Pug and Sass, since like I said, the coding process speeds up and it becomes simpler.
